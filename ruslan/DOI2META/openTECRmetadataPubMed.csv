One of the overall biochemical reactions catalyzed by anthranilate synthase is: chorismate(aq) + ammonia(aq) = anthranilate(aq) + pyruvate(aq) + H2O(l). This reaction can be divided into two partial reactions involving the intermediate 2-amino-4-deoxyisochorismate (ADIC): chorismate(aq) + ammonia(aq) = ADIC(aq) + H2O(l) and ADIC(aq) = anthranilate(aq) + pyruvate(aq). The native anthranilate synthase and a mutant form of it that is deficient in ADIC lyase activity but has ADIC synthase activity were used to study the overall ammonia-dependent reaction and the first of the above two partial reactions, respectively. Microcalorimetric measurements were performed on the overall reaction at a temperature of 298.15 K and pH 7.79. Equilibrium measurements were performed on the first partial (ADIC synthase) reaction at temperatures ranging from 288.15 to 302.65 K, and at pH values from 7.76 to 8.08. The results of the equilibrium and calorimetric measurements were analyzed in terms of a chemical equilibrium model that accounts for the multiplicity of ionic states of the reactants and products. These calculations gave thermodynamic quantities at the temperature 298.15 K and an ionic strength of zero for chemical reference reactions involving specific ionic forms. For the reaction: chorismate2-(aq) + NH4+(aq) = anthranilate-(aq) + pyruvate-(aq) + H+(aq) + H2O(l), delta rHmo = -(116.3 +/- 5.4) kJ mol-1. For the reaction: chorismate2-(aq) + NH4+(aq) = ADIC-(aq) + H2O(l), K = (20.3 +/- 4.5) and delta rHmo = (7.5 +/- 0.6) kJ mol-1. Thermodynamic cycle calculations were used to calculate thermodynamic quantities for three additional reactions that are pertinent to this branch point of the chorismate pathway. The quantities obtained in this study permit the calculation of the position of equilibrium of these reactions as a function of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Values of the apparent equilibrium constants and the standard transformed Gibbs energy changes delta rG'mo under approximately physiological conditions are given.",Feb 2000,"W M Byrnes, R N Goldberg, M J Holden, M P Mayhew, Y B Tewari"

The relative number of DNA nicks to phosphodiester bonds in a circular plasmid DNA, formed during this reaction at fixed concentrations of ATP to AMP and PP(i), was quantified. At 25 degrees C, pH 7, the equilibrium constant (K(eq)) for the ligation reaction is 3.89 x 10(4) m. This value corresponds to a standard free energy (DeltaG degrees ') of -6.3 kcal mol(-1).

The influence of the chain length and the presence of unsaturations in the fatty acids on the equilibrium position was measured and predicted. To predict equilibrium position the program TREP extended (TREPEX) based on the UNIFAC group contribution method was used. Using an equilibrium constant of 35, calculated on the basis of thermodynamic activities, the equilibrium position between butanol and saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids with different chain lengths can be predicted. The ester mole fraction at equilibrium increases with the fatty acid chain length, and for fatty acids with the same carbon number, the highest values are found for unsaturated fatty acids. For reaction systems containing two saturated fatty acids, a slightly higher mole fraction is obtained for the fatty acid with the higher chain length, while for mixtures consisting of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, the mole fractions of the unsaturated esters are lower than those of the saturated ones, regardless the chain length of the fatty acid. These experimental results are in good agreement with the calculations with TREPEX.",Feb 2000,"M V Flores, J J Sewalt, A E Janssen, A van der Padt"

The enzyme responsible for this activity, referred to as ADPG pyrophosphatase (AGPPase), was purified over 1,100-fold from barley leaves and subjected to biochemical characterization. The calculated K(eq)' (modified equilibrium constant) value for the ADPG hydrolytic reaction at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C is 110, and its standard-state free-energy change value (DeltaG') is -2.9 kcal/mol (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ). Kinetic analyses showed that, although AGPPase can hydrolyze several low-molecular weight phosphodiester bond-containing compounds, ADPG proved to be the best substrate (K(m) = 0.5 mM). P(i) and phosphorylated compounds such as 3-phosphoglycerate, PP(i), ATP, ADP, NADP(+), and AMP are inhibitors of AGPPase. Subcellular localization studies revealed that AGPPase is localized exclusively in the plastidial compartment of cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), whereas it occurs both inside and outside the plastid in barley endosperm. In this paper, evidence is presented that shows that AGPPase, whose activity declines concomitantly with the accumulation of starch during development of sink organs, competes with starch synthase (ADPG:1,4-alpha-d-glucan 4-alpha-d-glucosyltransferase; EC) for ADPG, thus markedly blocking the starch biosynthesis.",Jul 2000,"M Rodriguez-López, E Baroja-Fernández, A Zandueta-Criado, J Pozueta-Romero"

The enzyme encoded by the panE gene from E. coli K12 was overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. The native enzyme exists in solution as a monomer with a molecular mass of 34 000 Da. The steady-state initial velocity and product inhibition patterns are consistent with an ordered sequential kinetic mechanism in which NADPH binding is followed by ketopantoate binding, and pantoate release precedes NADP(+) release. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters V and V/K for substrates in both the forward and reverse reactions suggests the involvement of a single general acid/base in the catalytic mechanism. An enzyme group exhibiting a pK value of 8.4 +/- 0.2 functions as a general acid in the direction of the ketopantoate reduction, while an enzyme group exhibiting a pK value of 7.8 +/- 0.2 serves as a general base in the direction of pantoate oxidation. The stereospecific transfer of the pro-S hydrogen atom of NADPH to the C-2 position of ketopantoate was demonstrated by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 1.3 and 1.5 on V(for) and V/K(NADPH), respectively, and 2.1 and 1.3 on V(rev) and V/K(HP), respectively, suggest that hydride transfer is not rate-limiting in catalysis. Solvent kinetic isotope effects of 1.3 on both V(for) and V/K(KP), and 1.4 and 1.5 on V(rev) and V/K(HP), respectively, support this conclusion. The apparent equilibrium constant, K(eq)', of 676 at pH 7.5 and the standard free energy change, DeltaG, of -14 kcal/mol suggest that ketopantoate reductase reaction is very favorable in the physiologically important direction of pantoate formation.",Apr 2000,"R Zheng, J S Blanchard"

The apparent equilibrium constant, K', for the biochemical reaction P-enolpyruvate + ADP = ATP + Pyr was defined as K' = [ATP][Pyr]/[ADP][P-enolpyruvate], where each reactant represents the sum of all the ionic and metal complexed species in M. The K' at pH 7.0, 1.0 mm free Mg(2+) and I of 0.25 m was 3.89 x 10(4) (n = 8) at 25 degrees C. The standard apparent enthalpy (DeltaH' degrees ) for the biochemical reaction was -4.31 kJmol(-1) in the direction of ATP formation.

We examined further the mass action ratio in rat heart and skeletal muscle at rest and found that the pyruvate kinase reaction in vivo was close to equilibrium i.e. within a factor of about 3 to 6 of K' in the direction of ATP at the same pH, free [Mg(2+)], and T. We conclude that the pyruvate kinase reaction may be reversed under some conditions in vivo, a finding that challenges the long held dogma that the reaction is displaced far from equilibrium.",Jul 2002,"Geoffrey P Dobson, Sam Hitchins, Walter E Teague"

The model accounts for the effect of all four compounds in the reaction mixture, namely lauric acid, glucose, water, and lauroyl glucose ester. A supersaturated glucose solution was used to avoid limitations by glucose dissolution rate. Experiments with varied initial water content were performed to determine the effect of water on the initial reaction rate. The full time course of ester formation is described by five parameters: (a) three parameters evaluated from initial rate measurements; (b) the equilibrium constant, independently evaluated; and (c) one extra parameter fitted to the progress curve of ester formation. This reduced form of a full reversible kinetic model based on the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism is able to describe the complete course of lauroyl glucose ester synthesis.

The resulting native protein was overexpressed in erg 2 yeast cells and purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme exhibited a K (m) of 50 microM and a turnover number of 0.423 s(-1) for zymosterol, an isoelectric point of 7.70, a native molecular mass of 107000 Da and was tetrameric. The structural features of zymosterol provided optimal substrate acceptability. Biomimetic studies of acid-catalysed isomerization of zymosterol resulted in formation of cholest-8(14)-enol, whereas the enzyme-generated product was a Delta(7)-sterol, suggesting absolute stereochemical control of the reaction by hSI. Using (2)H(2)O and either zymosterol or cholesta-7,24-dienol as substrates, the reversibility of the reaction was confirmed by GC-MS of the deuterated products. The positional specific incorporation of deuterium at C-9alpha was established by a combination of (1)H- and (13)C-NMR analyses of the enzyme-generated cholesta-7,24-dienol. Kinetic analyses indicated the reaction equilibrium ( K (eq)=14; DeltaG(o')=-6.5 kJ/mol) for double-bond isomerization favoured the forward direction, Delta(8) to Delta(7).

The reactions were done in five buffer systems with enthalpy of protonation varying from -1.22 kcal/mol (phosphate) to -11.51 kcal/mol (Tris), allowing the determination of the number of protons released during glucose phosphorylation. The reaction is exothermic for both isozymes with a small, but significant (p < 0.0001), difference in the enthalpy of reaction (Delta HR), with an Delta HR of -5.1 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- S.D.) kcal/mol for Hxk1, and an Delta HR of -3.3 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- S.D.) kcal/mol for Hxk2. The Km for ATP determined by ITC was very similar to those reported in the literature for both isozymes. The effect of NaCl and KCl, from 0 to 200 mM, showed that although the rate of reaction decreases with increasing ionic strength, no change in the Delta HR was observed suggesting an entropic nature for the ionic strength.

The forward rate constants in these four steps were low, 8.3-27 s(-1), but the reverse rate constants of the activation and transfer reactions were considerably higher (230 and 161 s(-1)). Therefore, in the presence of even low concentrations of PP(i) and AMP, the rate limitation occurs at the late steps of the total reaction. AMP increases the rate of the ATP-PP(i) exchange reaction due to the high reverse rate in the transfer reaction. The rate equation obtained was used to calculate the steady-state enzyme intermediate concentrations and rates between the intermediates. Three different Mg2+ binding sites were required to describe the Mg2+ dependence. One of them was the normal binding to ATP and the others to tRNA or enzyme. The measured Mg2+ dependence of the apparent equilibrium constant of the ArgRS reaction was consistent with the Mg2+ dependences of the reaction rates on the rate equation. Chloride inhibits the ArgRS reaction, 160 mM KCl caused a 50% inhibition if the ionic strength was kept constant with K-acetate. KCl strongly affected the K(m)(app) (tRNA) value. A difference was detected in the progress curves between the aminoacylation and ATP-PP(i) exchange rates. When all free tRNA(Arg) had been used from the reaction mixture, the aminoacylation reaction stopped, but the ATP-PP(i) exchange continued at a lowered rate.",Feb 2006,R Kalervo Airas

The structure has a histidine triad (HIT)-like fold containing two distinct HIT-like motifs. The sequence of At5g18200.1 indicates a distant family relationship to the Escherichia coli galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase (GalT): the determined structure of the At5g18200.1 protein confirms this relationship. The At5g18200.1 protein does not demonstrate GalT activity but instead catalyzes adenylyl transfer in the reaction of ADP-glucose with various phosphates. The best acceptor among those evaluated is phosphate itself; thus, the At5g18200.1 enzyme appears to be an ADP-glucose phosphorylase. The enzyme catalyzes the exchange of (14)C between ADP-[(14)C]glucose and glucose-1-P in the absence of phosphate. The steady state kinetics of exchange follows the ping-pong bi-bi kinetic mechanism, with a k(cat) of 4.1 s(-)(1) and K(m) values of 1.4 and 83 microM for ADP-[(14)C]glucose and glucose-1-P, respectively, at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees C. The overall reaction of ADP-glucose with phosphate to produce ADP and glucose-1-P follows ping-pong bi-bi steady state kinetics, with a k(cat) of 2.7 s(-)(1) and K(m) values of 6.9 and 90 microM for ADP-glucose and phosphate, respectively, at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees C. The kinetics are consistent with a double-displacement mechanism that involves a covalent adenylyl-enzyme intermediate. The X-ray crystal structure of this intermediate was determined to 1.83 A resolution and shows the AMP group bonded to His(186). The value of K(eq) in the direction of ADP and glucose-1-P formation is 5.0 at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C in the absence of a divalent metal ion, and it is 40 in the presence of 1 mM MgCl(2).",Mar 2006,"Jason G McCoy, Abolfazl Arabshahi, Eduard Bitto, Craig A Bingman, Frank J Ruzicka, Perry A Frey, George N Phillips"

This is the first evidence for the presence of amino acid racemase in plant. The enzyme was effectively induced by the addition of L- or D-alanine, and we highly purified the enzyme to show enzymological properties. The enzyme exclusively catalyzed racemization of L- and D-alanine. The K(m) and V(max) values of enzyme for L-alanine were 29.6 x 10(-3) M and 1.02 mol/s/kg, and those for D-alanine are 12.0 x 10(-3) M and 0.44 mol/s/kg, respectively. The K(eq) value was estimated to be about 1 and indicated that the enzyme catalyzes a typical racemization of both enantiomers of alanine. The enzyme was inactivated by hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine and some other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzyme inhibitors. Accordingly, the enzyme required pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a coenzyme, and enzymologically resembled bacterial alanine racemases studied so far.",May 2006,"Kazutoshi Ono, Kazuki Yanagida, Tadao Oikawa, Tadashi Ogawa, Kenji Soda"

ODCase catalyzes the decarboxylation of orotidine monophosphate (OMP), producing uridine monophosphate (UMP). Novel inhibitors 6-amino-UMP and 6-cyano-UMP were designed on the basis of the substructure volumes in the substrate OMP and in an inhibitor of ODCase, barbituric acid monophosphate, BMP. A new enzyme assay method using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was developed to investigate the inhibition kinetics of ODCase. The reaction rates were measured by monitoring the heat generated during the decarboxylation reaction of orotidine monophosphate. Kinetic parameters (k(cat) = 21 s(-1) and KM = 5 microM) and the molar enthalpy (DeltaH(app) = 5 kcal/mol) were determined for the decarboxylation of the substrate by ODCase. Competitive inhibition of the enzyme was observed and the inhibition constants (Ki) were determined to be 12.4 microM and 29 microM for 6-aza-UMP and 6-cyano-UMP, respectively. 6-Amino-UMP was found to be among the potent inhibitors of ODCase, having an inhibition constant of 840 nM.

The methyl group is transferred onto the enzyme from a corrinoid-iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP). The kinetics of two steps within the catalytic mechanism were studied using the stopped-flow method, including the insertion of CO into a putative Ni(2+)-CH(3) bond and the transfer of the resulting acetyl group to CoA. Neither step had been studied previously. Reactions were monitored indirectly, starting with the methylated intermediate form of the enzyme. Resulting traces were analyzed by constructing a simple kinetic model describing the catalytic mechanism under reducing conditions. Besides methyl group transfer, CO insertion, and acetyl group transfer, fitting to experimental traces required the inclusion of an inhibitory step in which CO reversibly bound to the form of the enzyme obtained immediately after product release. Global simulation of the reported datasets afforded a consistent set of kinetic parameters. The equilibrium constant for the overall synthesis of acetyl-CoA was estimated and compared to the product of the individual equilibrium constants. Simulations obtained with the model duplicated the essential behavior of the enzyme, in terms of the variation of activity with [CO], and the time-dependent decay of the NiFeC EPR signal upon reaction with CoFeSP. Under standard assay conditions, the model suggests that the vast majority of active enzyme molecules in a population should be in the methylated form, suggesting that the subsequent catalytic step, namely CO insertion, is rate limiting. This conclusion is further supported by a sensitivity analysis showing that the rate is most sensitively affected by a change in the rate coefficient associated with the CO insertion step.",Sep 2006,"Xiangshi Tan, Ivan V Surovtsev, Paul A Lindahl"

In the opposite direction, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) adds to the enzyme first, while there is no preference for the order of binding of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-Kg) and lysine. In the direction of saccharopine formation, data also suggest that, at high concentrations, lysine inhibits the reaction by binding to free enzyme. In addition, uncompetitive substrate inhibition by alpha-Kg and double inhibition by NAD and alpha-Kg suggest the existence of an abortive E:NAD:alpha-Kg complex. Product inhibition by saccharopine is uncompetitive versus NADH, suggesting a practical irreversibility of the reaction at pH 7.0 in agreement with the overall K(eq). Saccharopine is noncompetitive versus lysine or alpha-Kg, suggesting the existence of both E:NADH:saccharopine and E:NAD:saccharopine complexes. NAD is competitive versus NADH, and noncompetitive versus lysine and alpha-Kg, indicating the combination of the dinucleotides with free enzyme. Dead-end inhibition studies are also consistent with the random addition of alpha-Kg and lysine. Leucine and oxalylglycine serve as lysine and alpha-Kg dead-end analogues, respectively, and are uncompetitive against NADH and noncompetitive against alpha-Kg and lysine, respectively. Oxaloacetate (OAA), pyruvate, and glutarate behave as dead-end analogues of lysine, which suggests that the lysine-binding site has a higher affinity for keto acid analogues than does the alpha-Kg site or that dicarboxylic acids have more than one binding mode on the enzyme. In addition, OAA and glutarate also bind to free enzyme as does lysine at high concentrations. Glutarate gives S-parabolic noncompetitive inhibition versus NADH, indicating the formation of a E:(glutarate)2 complex as a result of occupying both the lysine- and alpha-Kg-binding sites. Pyruvate, a slow alternative keto acid substrate, exhibits competitive inhibition versus both lysine and alpha-Kg, suggesting the combination to the E:NADH:alpha-Kg and E:NADH:lysine enzyme forms. The equilibrium constant for the reaction has been measured at pH 7.0 as 3.9 x 10(-7) M by monitoring the change in NADH upon the addition of the enzyme.

Data suggest a steady state random kinetic mechanism. The dissociation constant of the Mg-homoisocitrate complex (MgHIc) was estimated to be 11 +/- 2 mM as measured using Mg2+ as a shift reagent. Initial velocity data indicate the MgHIc complex is the reactant in the direction of oxidative decarboxylation, while in the reverse reaction direction, the enzyme likely binds uncomplexed Mg2+ and alpha-ketoadipate. Curvature is observed in the double-reciprocal plots for product inhibition by NADH and the dead-end inhibition by 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate when MgHIc is the varied substrate. At low concentrations of MgHIc, the inhibition by both nucleotides is competitive, but as the MgHIc concentration increases, the inhibition changes to uncompetitive, consistent with a steady state random mechanism with preferred binding of MgHIc before NAD. Release of product is preferred and ordered with respect to CO2, alpha-ketoadipate, and NADH. Isocitrate is a slow substrate with a rate (V/E(t)) 216-fold slower than that measured with HIc. In contrast to HIc, the uncomplexed form of isocitrate and Mg2+ bind to the enzyme. The kinetic mechanism in the direction of oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, on the basis of initial velocity studies in the absence and presence of dead-end inhibitors, suggests random addition of NAD and isocitrate with Mg2+ binding before isocitrate in rapid equilibrium, and the mechanism approximates rapid equilibrium random.

Studies on thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria. III. Adenosine triphosphate-sulfurylase of Clostridium nigrificans and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. J. Bacteriol. 84:1194-1201. 1962.-Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sulfurylase, which catalyzes the formation of adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) from ATP and SO(4) (=), has been purified from crude extracts of Clostridium nigrificans and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans by (NH(4))(2)SO(4) fractionation and triethylaminoethyl column chromatography. The enzyme from both sources operates over a broad pH range from 6.0 to 9.5. Below pH 6.0, activity decreases sharply, with no detectable activity at pH 5.0. Of the nucleotides tested (ATP and the triphosphates of deoxyadenosine, uridine, inosine, and guanosine), only ATP was acted upon by the enzyme from either source. The enzyme requires Mg(++) for activity. Incubation of the enzyme from both organisms with ATP and S(35)O(4) (=) in the presence of helium resulted in the formation of an S(35)-labeled nucleotide whose electrophoretic mobility was identical to that of chemically prepared APS. When incubated with ATP and the group VI anions (CrO(4), MoO(4), WO(4)), the enzyme from both organisms formed an unstable intermediate, resulting in the accumulation of pyrophosphate. Thermal stability studies revealed that the ATP-sulfurylase of C. nigrificans was stable at higher temperatures than the enzyme obtained from D. desulfuricans. Exposure of the enzyme from C. nigrificans to 65 C for 2 hr gave virtually no decrease in activity. In contrast, the enzyme from D. desulfuricans was completely inactivated after 30 min at 55 C, after 3 min at 60 C, or after 1 min at 65 C.",Dec 1962,"J M Akagi, L L Campbell"

The interconversion of hydroxypyruvate and l-glycerate in the presence of NAD and rat-liver l-lactate dehydrogenase has been demonstrated. Michaelis constants for these substrates together with an equilibrium constant have been determined and compared with those for pyruvate and l-lactate. 2. The presence of d-glycerate dehydrogenase in rat liver has been confirmed and the enzyme has been purified 16-20-fold from the supernatant fraction of a homogenate, when it is free of l-lactate dehydrogenase, with a 23-29% recovery. The enzyme catalyses the interconversion of hydroxypyruvate and d-glycerate in the presence of either NAD or NADP with almost equal efficiency. d-Glycerate dehydrogenase also catalyses the reduction of glyoxylate, but is distinct from l-lactate dehydrogenase in that it fails to act on pyruvate, d-lactate or l-lactate. The enzyme is strongly dependent on free thiol groups, as shown by inhibition with p-chloromercuribenzoate, and in the presence of sodium chloride the reduction of hydroxypyruvate is activated. Michaelis constants for these substrates of d-glycerate dehydrogenase and an equilibrium constant for the NAD-catalysed reaction have been calculated. 3.

Ureidoglycolate synthetase activity was maximal over the pH range of 8.4 to 8.8. No cofactors were required for the reaction. Enzyme activity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate at relatively high concentrations, by Hg(++) or Zn(++) ions, and to a lesser extent by several other metal cations. The maximal velocity for the purified ureidoglycolate synthetase, determined graphically from a Lineweaver-Burk plot, was 220 mumoles of glyoxylate formed per min per mg of protein. The substrate concentration required for half-maximal velocity was 3.3 x 10(-2)m. The equilibrium constant for the synthesis of ureidoglycolate was determined in a series of reaction mixtures covering a wide range of initial concentrations of reactants. The position of the equilibrium was not affected by a change in pH or by the presence of enzyme. The equilibrium constant for the reaction in the direction of synthesis was 7.6, corresponding to a negative free energy change of 1,230 cal per mole.",Dec 1965,"E T Gaudy, R S Wolfe"

Dobrogosz. Oxidative metabolism in Pediococcus pentosaceus. III. Glucose dehydrogenase system. J. Bacteriol. 90:653-660. 1965.-A method was developed for the purification of glucose dehydrogenase from Pediococcus pentosaceus Az-25-5. The procedures included treatments with protamine sulfate, ammonium sulfate, and heat in addition to acid precipitation, calcium phosphate adsorption and elution, and diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex column chromatography. The final preparation thus obtained was purified 255-fold and exhibited both similarities and dissimilarities to the same enzyme isolated from other sources. The enzyme is absolutely specific for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as a cofactor, and oxidizes only glucose or its analogue 2-deoxyglucose via the following reversible reaction: beta-d-glucose + NADP right harpoon over left harpoon d-glucono-delta-lactone + NADPH(2) + H(+). K(m) values were 2.3 x 10(-2) for glucose and 2 x 10(-4) for NADP. Monovalent cations were required for stability of the enzyme and stimulated activity. The pH optimum was 7.0, and the equilibrium constant was determined to be 13.4 x 10(-7) at pH 6.4. Among the Lactobacillaceae, glucose dehydrogenase activity was found to be essentially limited to members of the genus Pediococcus. Studies on the enzymatic composition of P. pentosaceus viewed in conjunction with other available data led to the conclusion that this enzyme is not involved to any significant extent in the energy metabolism of this organism.",Sep 1965,"C K Lee, W J Dobrogosz"

The forward and reverse reactions catalysed by ATP-creatine phosphotransferase have been studied kinetically at pH8.0 in the presence and absence of products, under conditions in which the free Mg(2+) concentration was maintained constant at 1mm. Thus at fixed pH the reaction may be considered as being bireactant and expressed as:MgATP(2-)+creatine(0)right harpoon over left harpoonMgADP(-)+phosphocreatine(2-)2. The initial-velocity pattern in the absence of products and the product-inhibition pattern have been determined. These are consistent with a random mechanism in which all steps are in rapid equilibrium except that concerned with the interconversion of the central ternary complexes, and in which two dead-end complexes (enzyme-MgADP-creatine and enzyme-MgATP-phosphocreatine) are formed. The results are in accord with previous suggestions that the enzyme possesses distinct sites for the combination of the nucleotide and guanidino substrates. 3. Values have been determined for the Michaelis and dissociation constants involved in the combination of each substrate with various enzyme forms. Although these values cannot be regarded as absolute, they appear to indicate that the presence of one substrate on the enzyme enhances the combination of the second substrate. In addition, it would seem that in the formation of the enzyme-MgADP-creatine complex the concentration of one reactant does not affect the combination of the other. This contrasts with the formation of the enzyme-MgATP-phosphocreatine complex, where each reactant hinders the combination of the other.",Oct 1965,"J F Morrison, E James"

The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the lactate-, beta-hydroxybutyrate- and glutamate-dehydrogenase systems were measured in rat livers freeze-clamped as soon as possible after death. The substrates of these dehydrogenases are likely to be in equilibrium with free NAD(+) and NADH, and the ratio of the free dinucleotides can be calculated from the measured concentrations of the substrates and the equilibrium constants (Holzer, Schultz & Lynen, 1956; Bücher & Klingenberg, 1958). The lactate-dehydrogenase system reflects the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio in the cytoplasm, the beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial cristae and the glutamate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial matrix. 2. The equilibrium constants of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were redetermined for near-physiological conditions (38 degrees ; I0.25). 3. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio of rat-liver cytoplasm was calculated as 725 (pH7.0) in well-fed rats, 528 in starved rats and 208 in alloxan-diabetic rats. 4. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio for the mitochondrial matrix and cristae gave virtually identical values in the same metabolic state. This indicates that beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase share a common pool of dinucleotide. 5. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio within the liver mitochondria of well-fed rats was about 8. It fell to about 5 in starvation and rose to about 10 in alloxan-diabetes. 6. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios of cytoplasm and mitochondria are thus greatly different and do not necessarily move in parallel when the metabolic state of the liver changes. 7. The ratios found for the free dinucleotides differ greatly from those recorded for the total dinucleotides because much more NADH than NAD(+) is protein-bound. 8. The bearing of these findings on various problems, including the following, is discussed: the number of NAD(+)-NADH pools in liver cells; the applicability of the method to tissues other than liver; the transhydrogenase activity of glutamate dehydrogenase; the physiological significance of the difference of the redox states of mitochondria and cytoplasm; aspects of the regulation of the redox state of cell compartments; the steady-state concentration of mitochondrial oxaloacetate; the relations between the redox state of cell compartments and ketosis.",May 1967,"D H Williamson, P Lund, H A Krebs"

An enzyme was isolated from leaves of tropical grasses that catalyses the reversible conversion of pyruvate, ATP and orthophosphate into phosphopyruvate, AMP and pyrophosphate. A requirement for Mg(2+) could not be replaced by Mn(2+) or Ca(2+). 2. By replacing orthophosphate with [(32)P]orthophosphate or with arsenate, evidence was provided that the orthophosphate consumed appears in pyrophosphate. 3. Without Mg(2+) or 2-mercaptoethanol the enzyme was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated. EDTA only partially replaced the requirement for the thiol compound. The enzyme was considerably more unstable at 0 degrees or when frozen than at 22 degrees . Even with the best conditions devised the enzyme lost about 25% of its activity every 3hr. 4. The activities of the enzyme in leaves of the tropical grasses sugar cane (Saccharum hybrid var. Pindar), maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were comparable with their maximum photosynthesis rates. The enzyme was not detectable in leaf extracts from several other plants. 5.

The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the ;malic' enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) were measured in freeze-clamped rat livers. By assuming that the reactants of these dehydrogenase systems are at equilibrium in the cytoplasm the [free NADP(+)]/[free NADPH] ratio was calculated. The justification of the assumption is discussed. 2. The values of this ratio obtained under different nutritional conditions (well-fed, 48hr.-starved, fed with a low-carbohydrate diet, fed with a high-sucrose diet) were all of the same order of magnitude although characteristic changes occurred on varying the diet. The value of the ratio fell on starvation and on feeding with the low-carbohydrate diet and rose slightly on feeding with the high-sucrose diet. 3. The mean values of the ratio were calculated to be between 0.001 and 0.015, which is about 100000 times lower than the values of the cytoplasmic [free NAD(+)]/[free NADH] ratio. 4. The differences in the redox state of the two nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide couples can be explained on a simple physicochemical basis. The differences are the result of equilibria that are determined by the equilibrium constants of a number of highly active readily reversible dehydrogenases and transaminases and the concentrations of the substrates and products of these enzymes. 5. The decisive feature is the fact that the NAD and NADP couples share substrates. This sharing provides a link between the redox states of the two couples. 6. The application of the method of calculation to data published by Kraupp, Adler-Kastner, Niessner & Plank (1967), Goldberg, Passonneau & Lowry (1966) and Kauffman, Brown, Passonneau & Lowry (1968) shows that the redox states of the NAD and NADP couples in cardiac-muscle cytoplasm and in mouse-brain cytoplasm are of the same order as those in rat liver. 7. The determination of the equilibrium constant at 38 degrees , pH7.0 and I 0.25 (required for the calculation of the [free NADP(+)]/[free NADPH] ratio), gave a value of 3.44x10(-2)m for the ;malic' enzyme (with CO(2) rather than HCO(3) (-) as the reactant) and a value of 1.98x10(-2)m(-1) for glutathione reductase.",Dec 1969,"R L Veech, L V Eggleston, H A Krebs"

The equilibrium constant at 38 degrees and I 0.25 of the triose phosphate isomerase reaction was found to be 22.0 and that of the aldolase reaction, 0.99x10(-4)m. The [dihydroxyacetone phosphate]/[glyceraldehyde phosphate] ratio was found to be 9.3 in rat liver. The causes of the apparent deviation of the triose phosphate isomerase system from equilibrium in vivo have been investigated. 2. The equilibria of the triose phosphate isomerase and aldolase reactions were studied with relatively large concentrations of crystalline enzymes and small concentrations of substrates, approximating to those found in rat liver and muscle. There was significant binding of fructose diphosphate by aldolase under these conditions. There was no evidence that binding of glyceraldehyde phosphate by either enzyme affected the equilibria. 3. The deviation from equilibrium of the triose phosphate isomerase system in rat liver can be accounted for by the low activity of the enzyme, in relation to the flux, at low physiological concentrations of glyceraldehyde phosphate (about 3mum). It has been calculated that a flux of 1.8mumoles/min./g. wet weight of liver would be expected to cause the measured degree of disequilibrium found in vivo. 4. The conclusion that the triose phosphate isomerase is not at equilibrium is in accordance with the situation postulated by Rose, Kellermeyer, Stjernholm & Wood (1962) on the basis of isotope-distribution data. 5. The triose phosphate isomerase system is closer to equilibrium in resting muscle probably because of a very low flux and a high enzyme concentration. 6. The aldolase system deviated from equilibrium in rat liver by a factor of about 10 and by a much greater factor in resting muscle. 7. The measurement of total dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate content indicates the concentrations of the free metabolites in the tissue. This may not hold for fructose diphosphate, a significant proportion of which may be bound to aldolase.",Dec 1969,"R L Veech, L Raijman, K Dalziel, H A Krebs"

Between 25 degrees and 45 degrees at pH7.0 enzyme action leads to an equilibrium mixture containing 65% meso-isomer and 35% ll-isomer. 4. The initial rate of epimerization was 2-3 times as fast with ll-diaminopimelic acid as substrate as with the meso-isomer; a number of other amino acids were not racemized by the enzyme. The Michaelis constants at 37 degrees were 6.7mm (ll-isomer) and 100mm (meso-isomer); with both substrates enzyme activity was maximal at pH7-8.

Changes in the concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, alanine, aspartate, malate, lactate, pyruvate, NAD(+), NADH and adenine nucleotides were measured in freeze-clamped rat liver during ischaemia. 2. Although the concentrations of most of the metabolites changed rapidly during ischaemia the ratios [glutamate]/[2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)] and [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] changed equally and the value of the expression [3-hydroxybutyrate][2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)]/[acetoacetate][glutamate] remained approximately constant, indicating that the 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase systems were at near-equilibrium with the mitochondrial NAD(+) couple. 3. The value of the expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] was about 0.7 in vivo and remained fairly constant during the ischaemic period of 5min, although the concentrations of alanine and oxoglutarate changed substantially. No explanation can be offered why the value of the ratio differed from that of the equilibrium constant of the alanine aminotransferase reaction, which is 1.48. 4. Injection of l-cycloserine 60min before the rats were killed increased the concentration of alanine in the liver fourfold and decreased the concentration of the other metabolites measured, except that of pyruvate. During ischaemia the concentration of alanine did not change but that of aspartate almost doubled. 5. After treatment with l-cycloserine the value in vivo of the expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] rose from 0.7 to 2.4. During ischaemia the value returned to 0.8. 6. The effects of l-cycloserine are consistent with the assumption that it specifically inhibits alanine aminotransferase. 7. Most of the alanine formed during ischaemia is probably derived from pyruvate and from ammonia released by the deamination of adenine nucleotides and glutamine. The alanine is presumably formed by the combined action of glutamate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase. 8. The rate of anaerobic glycolysis, calculated from the increase in the lactate concentration, was 1.3mumol/min per g fresh wt. 9. Although the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides changed rapidly during ischaemia, the ratio [ATP][AMP]/[ADP](2) remained constant at 0.54, indicating that adenylate kinase established near-equilibrium under these conditions.",Mar 1970,"J T Brosnan, H A Krebs, D H Williamson"

This enzyme was shown to catalyze the conversion of d-mannose and d-lyxose to ketoses. The ketose produced from mannose was identified as fructose by chemical and chromatographic methods. The reaction was shown to be reversible, the equilibrium ratio of fructose to mannose being approximately 65 to 35. The pH optimum was about 7.5, and the K(m) for mannose was estimated to be 7 x 10(-3)m. Mannose isomerase activity was greatest in cells grown on mannose, whereas cells grown on fructose had about 30% as much activity.

Several positive effectors (Gln, 2-hydroxyethyl-S-cysteine, Trp and Met) stimulate the back reaction in the same manner as the forward reaction. The apparent Michaelis constant for PP(i) is 2.2 mM at pH 7.35. The pH optimum of the back reaction is 6.5-7 while the pH optimum of the forward reaction is 7.6. The apparent equilibrium constant in the presence of 10 mM Mg(2+) at pH 7.36 is 8.5 in favor of adenylylated glutamine synthetase and PP(i). The equilibrium constant is strongly dependent from pH and from Mg(2+) concentration. There is a difference of about 0.5 to 1 kcal/mole free energy between the adenylyl-O-tyrosine bond and the pyrophosphate bond of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It follows from these considerations that the adenylyl-O-tyrosine bond is an ""energy-rich phosphate bond.""",Mar 1970,"M Mantel, H Holzer"

The values obtained (8.65-11.65) differ substantially from previously published values. The third acid dissociation constants were redetermined for 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate, and in contrast with previous reports the pK values (7.03 and 6.97 respectively at zero ionic strength) were closely similar. The Mg(2+)-binding constants were measured spectrophotometrically and the values, 286mm(-1) and 255mm(-1) for 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate at pH7 and ionic strength 0.02, were also very similar. From the relative lack of effect of temperature, pH and ionic strength it is concluded that the equilibrium constant differs from unity largely because of entropic factors. At low ionic strength, in the neutral region, the pH-dependence can be attributed to the small difference in the acid dissociation constants, but the difference in dissociation constants does not explain the pH-dependence in the acid region or at high ionic strength. Within physiological ranges of pH, Mg(2+) concentration and ionic strength there will be little variation in equilibrium constant.",Jun 1974,"J B Clarke, M Birch, H G Britton"

This equilibrium perturbation is caused by slower cleavage of C-D than C-H bonds during hydride transfer as malate-2-d and TPNH are partly converted into TPND and malate-2-h in the process of establishing isotopic equilibrium. With malate-2-d, isotope effects for malic enzyme at pH 7.1 and malate dehydrogenase at pH 9.3 of 1.45 and 1.70-2.16 (depending on oxaloacetate level) were determined with this method, while the corresponding isotope effects on V/Kmalate and V for the chemical reactions were 1.5-1.8 and 1.0, and 1.9 and 1.5 for the two enzymes. The advantage of this method is its extreme sensitivity, and the lack of interference from various artifacts.

It is independent of cyclic AMP when the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase is used. The optimum pH for the reverse reaction with 32P-labeled casein as the substrate is 5.7, essentially the same as that for the forward reaction. Among the nucleotide subtrates tested, ADP serves as the best phosphoryl group acceptor. The Km of the enzyme for ADP is 3.3 mM and that for 32P-casein is 1.7 mg/ml. The equilibrium constant at 30 degrees is approximately 0.042 at a magnesium concentration of 10 mM and a pH of 6.9.

Stopped-flow experiments showed initial very fast extinction changes at 605 nm and at 563 nm, indicating the simultaneous reduction of cytochrome a and oxidation of ferrocytochrome c. During this 'burst' phase, say the first 50 ms after mixing, it was invariably found that more cytochrome c had been oxidized than cytochrome a had been reduced. This discrepancy in electron equivalents may be accounted for by the rapid reduction of another redox site in the enzyme, possibly that associated with the extinction changes observed at 830 nm. During the incubation period in which the partially reduced oxidase was prepared, the rate of reduction of cytochrome a by ferrocytochrome c, at constant reactant concentrations, decreased with time. Temperature-jump experiments showed the presence of two relaxation processes. The faster of the two phases was assigned to the electron-transfer reaction between cytochrome c and cytochrome a. A study of the concentration-dependence of the reciprocal relaxation time for this phase yielded a rate constant of 9 X 10(6)M-1-s-1 for the electron transfer from cytochrome c to cytochrome a, and a value of 8.5 X 10(6)M-1-s-1 for the reverse reaction.

At pH 7.0 and taking the standard state of liquid water to have unit activity ([H2O] = 1), Kobs = 26.6 M at free [Mg2+] = 0 [epsilon G0obs = -2.03 kcal/mol(-8.48 kJ/mol)], 26.8 M at free [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M, and 28.4 M at free [Mg2+] = 10(-2) M.

These values apply only to situations where choline and Pi concentrations are both relatively low (such as the conditions found in most tissues). At higher concentrations of phosphate and choline, the value of Kobs becomes significantly increased since HPO42- complexes choline weakly (association constant = 3.3 M-1).

From the linewidths, the exchange rates between reactants and products may be evaluated. At pH 7.25 and a temperature of 12 degrees, the equilibrium constant at catalytic enzyme concentration: Keq = [MgADP] [P-arginine]/[MgATP] [L-arginine], is found to be 0.10 +/- 0.02 and that at stoichiometric enzyme concentration: K'eq = [E-MgADP] [E-P-arginine]/[E-MgATP] [E-arginine] to be 1.56 +/- 0.5. Thus, as the enzyme concentration increased, the production of P-arginine is increasingly favored. From the NMR line shapes in the presence of excess enzyme, the rate of the single step, the transfer of the phosphoryl group on the surface of the enzyme is found to be 192 +/- 15 s-1 in the forward direction, i.e. from E-MgATP, and 154 +/- 15 s-1 in the reverse direction from E-P-argine. At 12 degrees and pH 7.25, the rate of the overall reaction in the forward direction was determined from kinetic measurements to be 19 s-1, an order of magnitude slower than the rate measured by NMR. It can, therefore, be concluded that the interconversion of substrates on the surface of the enzyme is not the rate-determining step in the overal reaction.

Comparison of Ki values for competitive inhibitors suggested that binding of the l-carboxyl of L-malate is by ion pairing with lysine or arginine, while binding of the 4-carboxyl is weaker, and probably of the induced-dipolar type. The 2-hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to a catalytic group, which, when it is protonated, adsorbs the keto form of oxalacetate. Since the only molecule other than L-malate that is oxidized is L-malate-beta-amide, carbon 4 must be trigonal for substrate activity, although a tetrahedral carbon bearing one or two hydroxyl groups gives good binding. Hydroxy groups at carbon 3 contribute to binding, but prevent substrate activity. Hydroxy and ketomalonates are bound more strongly than any of the four carbon acids, suggesting that the latter are bound with some strain. In inhibition studies, pyruvate analogues were competitive vs. pyruvate but noncompetitive vs. malate, while malate analogues were competitive vs. malate and noncompetitive vs. pyruvate. These compounds thus bind to both enzyme-triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPN) and enzyme-reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPNH), but only malate analogues prevent release of TPN, while pyruvate analogues prevent release of TPNH. Ketomalonate and oxalacetate, both of which are slowly reduced by the enzyme in the presence of TPNH and thus must combine in the keto form with E-TPNH,, appear to combine with E-TPN mainly in the gem-diol (or for oxalacetate, also the enol) form.

Double reciprocal plots for methyl viologen reduction and oxidation at pH values 7.0-9.85 are linear, and the plots for reduction and oxidation are intersecting. Such data are consistent with a mechanism in which the H2 and one methyl viologen bind (either in order or randomly) with subsequent reduction and release of the methyl viologen. A second methyl viologen then is bound, reduced and released. Comparison of the calculated Keq' with the Haldane expression in which both methyl viologens react at the same rate show a large difference. This difference indicates that the two methyl viologens react at different rates. Addition of oxidized electron carriers inhibits the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction (i.e., the exchange of protons between H2 and 2H2O). CO reversibly inhibits methyl viologen reduction and is competitive vs. H2. O2 acts as an irreversible inhibitor.",Jul 1978,"D L Erbes, R H Burris"

The enzyme can catalyze three phosphoryl transfer reactions: mutase, bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase, and bisphosphoglycerate synthase. The mutase rate was measured in the favorable direction (Keq = glycerate-3-P/glycerate-2-P approximately equal to 12) using [2T]glycerate-2-P as substrate. The bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase activity was studied in the presence of the activator, glycolate-2-P. The latter is an analog of the glycerate-P's and appears to act as an abortive mutase substrate. The kinetic pattern obtained with both activities is that of a ping-pong mechanism with inhibition by the second substrate occurring at a lower concentration than the Km value for that substrate. The kinetic parameters for the mutase determined in 50 mM N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-amino]ethanesulfonate (TES)/sodium buffer containing 0.1 M KCl, pH 7.5, 25 degrees C are: Km glycerate-2,3-P2, 0.069 micron; Km glycerate-2-P, 14 micron; Km glycerate-3-P approximately 200 micron; Ki glycerate-2-P, 4 micron. The kinetic parameters for the phosphatase reaction in 50 mM triethanolamine/Cl- buffer, pH 7.5, 25 degrees C are: Km glycerate-2,3-P2, 0.065 micron:Km glycolate-2P, 479 micron; Ki glycolate-2-P, 135 micron. The enzyme is sensitive to changes in the ionic environment. Increasing salt concentrations activate the phosphatase in the presence of glycolate-2-P by decreasing the apparent Km of glycerate-2,3-P2. The effects are due to the anionic component and Cl- greater than acetate greater than TES. The same salts are competitive inhibitors with respect to glycolate-2-P. With high levels of KCl that produce a 30-fold decrease in the apparent maximal velocity due to competition with glycolate-2-P, the Km of glycerate-2,3-P2 remains low. These observations lead us to postulate that each monophosphoglycerate substrate has a separate site on the enzyme and that glycerate-2,3-P2 can bind to either site. The binding of anions to one site of the nonphosphorylated enzyme allows an increase in the on and off rates of glycerate-2,3-P2 at the alternate site. Salts inhibit the mutase reaction. The Km of glycerate-2,3-P2 is increased as is that of glycerate-2-P. The effect on the Km of glycerate-2,3-P2 is attributed to an increase in the off rate/on rate ratio for glycerate-2,3-P2. The bisphosphoglycerate synthase reaction is shown to require added glycerate-3-P. The equilibrium between enzyme and glycerate-1,3-P2 is favorable (Kdiss less than or equal 7 X 10(-8) M) and suggests that in the absence of a separate synthase this reaction may have functional significance.",Dec 1978,"Z B Rose, S Dube"

A variety of phosphonates have been shown to substitute for phosphate in this reaction [Gardner, J. H., & Byers, L. D., (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5925--5927]. The dependence of the logarithm of the equilibrium constant for the reaction on the pKa2 value of the phosphonate is characterized by a Brłnsted coefficient, betaeq, of approximately 1. This represents the sensitivity of the transfer of the phosphoglyceroyl group between the active-site sulfhydryl residue (in the acyl-enzyme intermediate) and the acyl acceptor on the basicity of the acyl acceptor. Molybdate (MoO42-) can also serve as an acyl acceptor in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction. The second-order rate constant for the reaction with molybdate is only approximately 12 times lower than the reaction with phosphate even though the pKa2 of molybdate is 3.1 units lower than the pKa2 of phosphate. The immediate product of the molybdate reaction is the acyl molybdate, 1-molybdo-3-phosphoglycerate. The acyl molybdate, like the acyl arsenate (the immediate product of the reaction when arsenate is the acyl acceptor), is kinetically unstable. At pH 7.3 (25 degrees C), the half-life for hydrolysis of the acyl molybdate, or the acyl arsenate, is less than 2.5 s. Thus, hydrolysis of 1-molybdo- and 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate is at least 2000 times faster than hydrolysis of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate under the same conditions. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has a fairly broad specificity for acyl acceptors. Most tetrahedral oxy anions tested are substrates for the enzyme (except SO4(2-) and SeO4(2-)). Tetrahedral monoanions such as ReO4- and GeO(OH)3- are not substrates but do bind to the enzyme. These results suggest the requirement of at least one anionic site on the acyl acceptor required for binding and another anionic group on the acyl receptor required for nucleophilic attack on the acyl enzyme.",Jun 1979,"L D Byers, H S She, A Alayoff"

The activity of the enzyme, which catalyzes an NADP-dependent oxidation of the substrate to glucose-6-phosphate, was detected in leaves of Prunus mume, Prunus persica, Rhaphiolepsis indica, Sorbus aucuparia, Cydonia oblonga, Photinia glabra, Sorbaria kirilowii, and Spiraea thunbergii.The enzyme was purified about 60-fold from leaves of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) using affinity chromatography with Blue Sepharose. Neither mannitol-1-phosphate nor fructose-6-phosphate served as substrate. Molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 65,000 at pH 8.0 by gel filtration. Since sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a peptide of 33,000 daltons, the enzyme was assumed to be a dimer at pH 8.0 K(m) values for sorbitol-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, NADP, and NADPH were 2.22 millimolar, 11.6 millimolar, 13.5 micromolar, and 1.61 micromolar, respectively. Equilibrium constant for sorbitol-6-phosphate oxidation was 5.12 x 10(-10). Optimal pH for sorbitol-6-phosphate oxidation was 9.8. The enzyme showed its maximum activity within a broad pH range between 7 and 9 for glucose-6-phosphate reduction. The enzyme was more effective in the direction of glucose-6-phosphate reduction than in the reverse direction at neutral pH.

The reverse reaction could be monitored spectrophotometrically by use of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate). In addition to 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), 2,2'-dithiobispyridine and cystamine were used to promote the reverse reaction. S-D-Lactoylglutathione did not hydrolyze in the presence of glyoxalase I under the conditions investigated, as shown by its stability in the absence of thioltrapping agents. Proof of the reversal of the reaction was obtained by demonstrating the formation of stoichiometric amounts of methylglyoxal and glutathione from S-D-lactoylglutathione. Catalysis of the reverse reaction was dependent upon the presence of a bivalent metal ion in the active site of the enzyme. Apoenzyme, obtained by removal of the essential Zn2+ from the active site, did not catalyze the reverse reaction, but catalytic activity was restored by addition of Zn2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+. The reverse reaction was also catalyzed by glyoxalase I from yeast. Linear competitive inhibition (Ki = 0.64 mM) was obtained with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), which necessitated correction of the apparent kinetic parameters of the reverse reaction. The corrected values for the reverse reaction catalyzed by glyoxalase I from human erythrocytes with S-D-lactoylglutathione as substrate were kcat = 3.6 s-1 and Km = 1.9 mM. Combination of these values with the corresponding parameters for the forward reaction allowed calculation, through the Haldane relation, of the equilibrium constant, Keq = 1.1 X 10(4), for the isomerization between the hemimercaptal of methylglyoxal and glutathione and S-D-lactoylglutathione.

The reaction can be followed spectrophotometrically or by analysis of the reaction mixture by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The products have also been isolated and characterized. Oxygen uptake during the reaction is much less than stoichiometric with H2folate disappearance and is attributed to autoxidation of the H4folate formed. The dismutation activity is a property of highly purified Streptococcus faecium DHFR isoenzyme 2 (but not isoenzyme 1) and of Lactobacillus casei DHFR, but not of bovine liver DHFR. The activity is dependent on tightly bound NADP+ and/or NADPH. Removal of the nucleotide results in loss of dismutation activity, which is restored by adding NADP+ or NADPH. Maximum activity is obtained when approximately 1 mol equiv of nucleotide is added per mol of DHFR. It is proposed that in the dismutation reaction bound NADP(H) is alternately reduced and oxidized by incoming molecules of H2folate with release of folate and H4folate, respectively. The relatively slow rate of folate formation presumably limits the rate of the overall reaction. The equilibrium constant for the dismutation reaction is 19.4 +/- 7.4 at 22 degrees C and pH 7.0. Calculation of standard oxidation-reduction potentials at pH 7 gave values of -0.230 V for the H2folate/H4 folate pair and -0.268 V for the folate/H2folate pair.

The purified enzyme preparation was homogeneous on analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was free from contaminating enzymes including NADH oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase. The enzyme catalyzed the cleavage of N-acetylneuraminic acid to N-acetylmannosamine and pyruvate in a reversible reaction. Both cleavage and synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid had the same pH optimum around 7.7. The enzyme was stable between pH 6.0 to 9.0, and was thermostable up to 60 degrees C. The thermal stability increased up to 75 degrees C in the presence of pyruvate. No metal ion was required for the enzyme activity, but heavy metal ions such as Ag+ and Hg2+ were potent inhibitors. Oxidizing agents such as N-bromosuccinimide, iodine, and hydrogen peroxide, and SH-inhibitors such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and mercuric chloride were also potent inhibitors. The Km values for N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid were 3.6 mM and 4.3 mM, respectively. Pyruvate inhibited the cleavage reaction competitively; Ki was calculated to be 1.0 mM. In the condensation reaction, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, glucosamine, and galactosamine could not replace N-acetylmannosamine as substrate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate, beta-hydroxypyruvate, and other pyruvate derivatives could not replace pyruvate as substrate. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 98,000 by gel filtration methods. After denaturation in sodium dodecyl sulfate or in 6 M guanidine-HCl, the molecular weight was reduced to 33,000, indicating the existence of 3 identical subunits.

Purified calcium ATPase was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles enabling control of the transmembrane calcium gradient. Calcium transport was monitored spectrophotometrically by the calcium indicator, Arsenazo III. Thus, only the enzymatic activity of coupled transport was measured. It was shown under conditions of low external calcium that ATP hydrolysis and synthesis follow simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and that Michaelis constants obtained for both processes appear independent of the calcium gradient. The maximum velocities for both hydrolysis and synthesis strongly depend on the transmembrane calcium gradient. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed in which a random addition of substrates for ATP synthesis is followed by random release of ATP and calcium. By measuring the ATP hydrolysis and synthesis under identical conditions, determination of the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis as a function of the transmembrane calcium gradient was possible. Our results indicate that the thermodynamics of the catalytic cycle can be totally accounted for by the energetics of transport of 2.2 +/- 0.3 calciums and the hydrolysis of 1 ATP.

The Sp diastereomer of ATP alpha S was the preferred substrate regardless of the metal ion used, consistent with the metal ion not binding to the alpha-phosphate. With ATP beta S, the Sp diastereomer was the preferred substrate with Mg2+, and the Rp diastereomer was the preferred substrate with Cd2+. The reversal of specificity establishes that the metal is chelated through the beta-phosphate in the active site of the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction. A comparison of the Vmax values as a function of substitution of oxygen by sulfur showed the order for Mg2+ to be: ATP greater than ATP alpha S(Sp) greater than ATP alpha S(Rp) greater than ATP beta S(Sp) greater than ATP gamma S greater than ATP beta S(Rp). With Cd2+ as the activating metal ion, the order was: ATP greater than ATP alpha S(Sp) greater than ATP alpha S(Rp) greater than ATP beta S(Rp) greater than ATP gamma S greater than ATP beta S(Sp). It is concluded that the chelate structure of metal ATP substrate in the phosphomevalonate kinase reaction is the delta, beta, gamma-bidentate complex. 31P NMR measurements and radioassay with [2-14C] phosphomevalonate were used to measure the equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by phosphomevalonate kinase with ATP and phosphorothioate analogues of ATP as the phosphoryl group donor.

Using commercially available enzymes all three assays come to a clear endpoint with the assays described. Values for these metabolites in liver in three dietary states are reported; 48 h starved, ad libitum feeding of standard NIH rat ration, and meal feeding of a fat-free diet. Xylulose 5-phosphate values were 3.8 +/- 0.3, 8.6 +/- 0.3, and 66.3 +/- 8.3 nmol/g. Ribulose 5-phosphate values were 3.4 +/- 0.3, 5.8 +/- 0.2, and 37.1 +/- 5.3 nmol/g. Combined ribose 5-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate were 29.3 +/- 0.3, 38.2 +/- 1.2, and 108.2 +/- 14.5 nmol/g. The ratio of measured tissue content of [xylulose 5-phosphate]/[ribulose 5-phosphate] was found to be 1.12 +/- 0.07 in starved animals, 1.48 +/- 0.04 in ad libitum fed animals and 1.78 +/- 0.03 in low-fat meal fed animals. These data are in good agreement with the range of equilibrium constants reported for this reaction, suggesting that the ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase reaction (EC 5.1.3.1) is a near equilibrium reaction despite a more than 10-fold change in the tissue content of these metabolites.",Dec 1986,"J P Casazza, R L Veech"

Inactivation-protection studies have established the binding of adenine to AMP nucleosidase in the absence of ribose 5-phosphate. Product inhibition by adenine suggests a dead-end complex of enzyme, AMP, and adenine. Methanol does not act as a nucleophile to replace H2O in the reaction, and products do not exchange into substrate during AMP hydrolysis. Thus, the reactive complex has the properties of concerted hydrolysis by an enzyme-directed water molecule rather than by formation of a covalent intermediate with ribose 5-phosphate. The Vmax in the forward reaction (AMP hydrolysis) is 300-fold greater than that in the reverse reaction. The Keq for AMP hydrolysis has been experimentally determined to be 170 M and is in reasonable agreement with Keq values of 77 and 36 M calculated from Haldane relationships. The equilibrium for enzyme-bound substrate and products strongly favors the enzyme-product ternary complex ([enzyme-adenine ribose 5-phosphate]/[enzyme-AMP] = 480).

About 10 beta-galactosyl-galactose and 10 beta-galactosyl-glucose gas-liquid chromatographic peaks were detected and it is thus very likely that every possible isomer of beta-galactosyl-galactose and beta-galactosyl-glucose was formed by the reversion reactions (taking into account both anomers for each isomer). The presence of lactose and allolactose among the beta-galactosyl-glucoses was confirmed with standards. An important finding relating to the role of allolactose as an inducer of the lac operon was that allolactose (beta-D-galactosyl-(1----6)-D-glucose) was the only disaccharide formed initially, and at equilibrium it was present in the largest amount (50%). Obviously the enzyme is specific in its ability to form allolactose, and allolactose is the most stable beta-galactosyl-glucose, both important inducer properties. The equilibrium constant (concentration of disaccharides divided by the concentration of reactants at equilibrium) of the reaction was about 9.5 mM-1. This is the first report of an equilibrium constant for the beta-galactosidase reaction. Of mechanistic significance is the fact that only three compounds were able to replace D-galactose as a reversion reactant. Two of these (L-arabinose and D-fucose) had alterations at carbon 6. The 6 position, therefore, is not essential for reactivity. The third compound was D-galactal. Any other sugars tested (even with very minor changes relative to D-galactose) did not react. Of special consequence is the 2 position. The results strongly suggest that there has to be either an equatorial hydroxyl at the 2 position of a sugar or a special reactivity (as with D-galactal) in order for the enzyme to catalyze the beta-galactosidase reaction.",Apr 1986,"R E Huber, K L Hurlburt"

This is a model reaction giving a condensation product with dissociating groups. The kinetics for the synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe in aqueous solution saturated with ethyl acetate was expressed by a rate equation for the rapid-equilibrium random bireactant mechanism, and the reverse hydrolysis reaction was zero-order with respect to Z-Asp-PheOMe concentration. The courses of synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe in the biphasic system were well explained, by the rate equations obtained for the aqueous solution and by the partition of substrate and condensation product between the both phases. The rate of synthesis in the biphasic system was much lower than in aqueous solution due to the unfavorable partition of PheOMe in the aqueous phase. The equation for the equilibrium yield of Z-Asp-PheOMe in the biphasic system was derived assuming that only the non-ionized forms of the substrate and condensation product exist in the organic phase. It was found theoretically and experimentally that the yield of Z-Asp-PheOMe is maximum at the aqueous-phase pH of around 5, lower than for synthesis in aqueous solution. The effect of the organic solvent on the rate and equilibrium for the synthesis of Z-Asp-PheOMe could be explained by the variation in the partition coefficient.

This scheme was derived from measuring association and dissociation rate constants and pre-steady-state transients by using stopped-flow fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. The binding kinetics suggest that during steady-state turnover product dissociation follows a specific, preferred pathway in which tetrahydrofolate (H4F) dissociation occurs after NADPH replaces NADP+ in the ternary complex. This step, H4F dissociation from the E X NADPH X H4F ternary complex, is proposed to be the rate-limiting step for steady-state turnover at low pH because koff = VM.

This scheme accounts for the apparent pKa = 8.4 observed in the steady state as due to a change in the rate-determining step from product release at low pH to hydride transfer above pH 8.4.

The rate of the [14C]Asp in equilibrium N-carbamoyl L-aspartate (C-Asp) exchange reaction was five times faster than that of [32P]carbamyl phosphate (C-P) in equilibrium Pi, which argues strongly against the rapid equilibrium random mechanism previously proposed by E. Heyde, A. Nagabhushanam, and J. F. Morrison [Biochemistry 12, 4718-4726 (1973]. Substrate concentrations were varied either as reactant-product pairs (holding the other pair constant) or together simultaneously in constant ratio at equilibrium. The resulting kinetic saturation patterns were most consistent with a preferred order random kinetic mechanism, with C-P binding prior to Asp and with C-Asp being released before Pi. Weak inhibition effects at high substrate levels could be accounted for by multiple weak dead-end complexes or ionic strength effects. Computer-based simulations have led to a set of rate constants that fit the experimental data, are in agreement with rate constants measured previously by pre-steady-state methods, and predict the correct initial velocities in the forward and reverse directions. Simulations also show that rate constants consistent with any of the various alternative mechanisms do not provide good fit to the experimental data. A model for the kinetic mechanism is considered, in which the binding of Asp prior to C-P may restrict access of C-P to the active site, but C-P binding prior to Asp potentiates the enzyme for the allosteric (T-R) transition, centered entirely upon the Asp binding process.",Dec 1987,"Y Hsuanyu, F C Wedler"

In this paper we show that enzyme activated by S-[2,8,5'-3H]adenosylmethionine catalyzes the conversion of L-lysine to the equilibrium mixture of L-lysine and L-beta-lysine with incorporation of high levels of tritium into both isomers. The tritium levels in the isomers reflect the equilibrium constant for their interconversion, 84% in the L-beta-lysine and 16% in L-lysine compared with Keq = 5.3 +/- 0.3 in the direction of the formation of L-beta-lysine at pH 7.7 and 30 degrees C. No significant tritium is incorporated into lysine from S-[2,8-3H]adenosylmethionine or S-adenosyl[methyl-3H] methionine under comparable conditions. Therefore, the tritium incorporated into lysine in the former reaction arises from the 5'-position of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group in S-adenosylmethionine. These experiments implicate the 5'-deoxyadenosyl portion of S-adenosylmethionine in the hydrogen transfer mechanism of this reaction, perhaps in a role analogous to that played by the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety of deoxyadenosyl cobalamin in coenzyme B12-dependent rearrangements.",Nov 1987,"M Moss, P A Frey"

In both cases, the mechanism is predominantly steady state ordered with MgATP binding first in the direction of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) phosphorylation and rapid equilibrium random in the direction of MgADP phosphorylation. This is a unique kinetic mechanism for a phosphofructokinase. Product inhibition by MgADP is competitive versus MgATP and noncompetitive versus F6P while fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is competitive versus fructose 6-phosphate and uncompetitive versus MgATP. The uncompetitive pattern obtained versus F6P is indicative of a dead-end E.MgATP.FBP complex. Fructose 6-phosphate is noncompetitive versus either FBP or MgADP. Dead-end inhibition by arabinose 5-phosphate or 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 6-phosphate is uncompetitive versus MgATP corroborating the ordered addition of MgATP prior to F6P. In the direction of MgADP phosphorylation, inhibition by anhydromannitol 1,6-bisphosphate is noncompetitive versus MgADP, while Mg-adenosine 5'(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate is noncompetitive versus FBP.

Mutations altering the reversibility of GPM have been obtained in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While wild-type cells grow on glycolytic (glucose) or gluconeogenic (ethanol) substrates, cells with altered GPMs fall into three categories based on their phenotypes 1) glucose- ethanol-, 2) glucose+ ethanol-, and 3) glucose- ethanol+. Cells with the first two phenotypes possessed GPMs that functioned irreversibly in the glycolytic direction. Cells that were glucose- ethanol+ possessed an enzyme that functioned reversibly. All of the altered GPMs had maximal velocities that were less than 3% of the wild-type level. The properties of the altered GPMs studied here provide a rationale for the occurrence in the glycolytic pathway of several glycolytic enzymes such as GPM, which function at high velocities in relation to the much smaller metabolic flux that they support. The altered GPMs were purified and estimates of their kinetic constants obtained. Free energy profiles were drawn for catalysis by the wild type and a mutant GPM that functioned irreversibly. The mutant enzyme was very inefficient. It was shown that an enzyme that functions irreversibly at a reaction with a Keq value close to 1 would necessarily be inefficient while it could evolve to be efficient when catalyzing a reaction that has a Keq value much greater than 1. In the glycolytic path this could be the reason for the characteristic presence of enzymes that function irreversibly at reactions with large Keq values.",Oct 1988,N Gautam

For the mutant enzyme, the kcat for which is some 10(3) times less than that for the wild-type enzyme, the value of kcat/Km with glyceraldehyde phosphate as substrate is almost unaffected by the presence of sucrose or glycerol, even though the concentration of the aldehyde form of the substrate is smaller because of hemiacetal formation. [The nature and relative amounts of the various forms of triose phosphate present in solution (free carbonyl forms, hydrates, dimers, hemiacetal adducts) have been evaluated by 31P NMR and are presented in the Appendix.] The viscosogenic agents cause the substrate to bind more tightly to the enzyme, roughly compensating for the lower substrate concentration. With dihydroxyacetone phosphate as substrate, the values of kcat/Km for the mutant enzyme increase with the addition of viscosogenic agent, consistent with the tighter binding of substrate without (in this case) any concomitant loss due to hemiketal formation. These results for the mutant enzyme (known to be limited in rate by an enolization step in the catalytic mechanism) can be used to interpret the behavior of the wild-type enzyme. Plots of the relative values of kcat/Km for catalysis by the wild-type enzyme (normalized with the corresponding data for the mutant enzyme) against the relative viscosity have slopes close to unity, as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation for a cleanly diffusive process. In the presence of polymeric viscosogenic additives such as poly(ethylene glycol), polyacrylamide, or ficoll, no effect on kcat/Km is seen for the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the expectation that molecular diffusion rates are unaffected by the macroviscosity and are only slowed by the presence of smaller agents that raise the microviscosity. These results show that the reaction catalyzed by the wild-type triosephosphate isomerase is limited by the rate at which glyceraldehyde phosphate encounters, or departs from, the active site.",Feb 1988,"S C Blacklow, R T Raines, W A Lim, P D Zamore, J R Knowles"

The pI values were 5.0 for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase and 4.6 for benzaldehyde dehydrogenase II. Neither enzyme activity was affected when assayed in the presence of a range of salts.

Using pyroelectric poly(vinylidene 1,1-difluoride) detectors that simultaneously measure transretinal voltage and retinal temperature change, four heat effects assignable to known biochemical cycles in rods have been found. As the dark current shuts down after a flash causing 180-1800 rhodopsin photoisomerizations per rod, a heat burst, q1, raises the retinal temperature 1-2 microK. q1 is closely regulated in size and slightly precedes dark current shutdown. Isobutylmethylxanthine slows and enlarges q1, delaying the dark-current response. Increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+ stops the dark current without affecting q1.

The Kobs for phosphoesters such as phosphoserine, glucose phosphate, glycerol phosphate, and ethylene glycol phosphate varied little over this wide range of conditions, the extreme values of Kobs being 12 and 200 M. In contrast, the Kobs for the phosphoanhydride bond of pyrophosphate varied from a value greater than 20,000 to 0.1 M. In totally aqueous media at a pH between 7.0 and 8.0 and in the presence of 0.5-1.0 mM MgCl2, the energy of hydrolysis of pyrophosphate was 1.2-4.0 kcal/mol greater than that of phosphoserine. However, when the water activity was decreased by adding polyethylene glycol to the medium within the same pH and MgCl2 concentration range, the energy of hydrolysis of phosphoserine became 2.0-2.5 kcal/mol greater than that of pyrophosphate.

To study this question, we have cloned the Salmonella typhimurium pyrE gene, coding for the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.2.4.10, OPRTase), and developed a bacterial strain that overproduces the enzyme, which we have purified to homogeneity. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicated that S. typhimurium OPRTase follows a random sequential kinetic mechanism. This result was further confirmed by equilibrium isotope exchange studies on two substrate-product pairs, PRPP-PPi and OMP-orotate. In addition, the rates of the individual equilibrium isotope exchanges allowed us to conclude that PPi release and PRPP release were the rate-determining steps in the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. Although partial reactions between the two substrate-product pairs, PRPP-PPi and OMP-orotate, were observed, further studies revealed that these exchanges were a result of contaminations. Our results are significant in that S. typhimurium OPRTase, like most PRTases but in contrast to its yeast homologue, follows sequential kinetics. The artifactual partial isotope exchanges found in this work may have implications for similar prior work on the yeast enzyme.

Lacking regulatory features, the catalytic domain simplified data collection, analysis, and interpretation. To further facilitate this study, a synthetic peptide was used as the kinase substrate. Initial velocity measurements of the forward reaction were consistent with a sequential mechanism. The patterns of product and dead-end inhibition studies best fit an ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism with ATP binding first to the enzyme, followed by binding of the peptide substrate. Initial-rate patterns of the reverse reaction of the kinase suggested a rapid-equilibrium mechanism with obligatory ordered binding of ADP prior to the phosphopeptide substrate; however, this apparent rapid-equilibrium ordered mechanism was contrary to the observed inhibition by the phosphopeptide which is not supposed to bind to the kinase in the absence of ADP. Inspection of product inhibition patterns of the phosphopeptide with both ATP and peptide revealed that an ordered Bi Bi mechanism can show initial-rate patterns of a rapid-equilibrium ordered system when a Michaelis constant for phosphopeptide, Kip, is large relative to the concentration of phosphopeptide used. Thus, the results of this study show an ordered Bi Bi mechanism with nucleotide binding first in both directions of the kinase reaction.

The ionic strength dependence was similar for both detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted cytochrome c oxidase.

Additional experiments involving direct transfer of the enzyme from low to high salt conditions produced negligible enthalpy changes that remained constant within experimental error throughout the salt concentrations studied (0-200 mM KCl).

Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes this reaction when the reductant is NADPH and gives as products L-pipecolic acid and NADP+. The reaction velocity for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is measurable in either direction. The pH-independent equilibrium constant, Keq, for the reduction of the imino acid by NADPH to give pipecolic acid anion and NADP+ was determined from the equilibrium conditions and the pKa values of pipecolic acid (10.72) and of the cyclic imino acid (8.10). The value of Keq was found to be 175 +/- 30; the values of delta G0, delta H0 and delta S0 are -3.1 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol, 5 +/- 1 kcal/mol and 27 +/- 4 e.u., respectively. The data indicate that the reactants are far more solvated than the products and that there must be a large degree of solvent reorganization during the course of the reaction.

The selectivity of galactosyl-ebgab between water and methanol on a molar basis is 57, similar to the value for galactosyl-ebgb. 5. The equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of lactose at 37 degrees C is 152 +/- 19 M, that for hydrolysis of allolactose is approx. 44 M and that for hydrolysis of lactulose is approx. 40 M. 6. A comparison of the free-energy profiles for the hydrolyses of lactose catalysed by the double mutant with those for the wild-type and the single mutants reveals that free-energy changes from the two mutations are not in general independently additive, but that the changes generally are in the direction predicted by the theory of Burbaum, Raines, Albery & Knowles [(1989) Biochemistry 28, 9283-9305] for an enzyme catalysing a thermodynamically irreversible reaction. 7.

It catalyzes the formation of the adenylate of 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA) from the free acid and ATP in an equilibrium reaction. 4-MHA is the precursor of the chromophoric part of actinomycin. By using the 4-MHA analogue, 4-methyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid, as a model substrate it could be established that the equilibrium constant Keq is independent on enzyme concentration, which suggests that no stoichiometric acyladenylate-enzyme complex is formed in contrast to observations made with aminoacyl adenylates formed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases or multifunctional peptide synthetases. Actinomycin synthetase I does not charge itself with substrate carboxylic acid via a covalent thioester bond as is usual for amino acid activation in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. In addition, the enzyme does not act as an acyl-coenzyme A ligase as revealed by its inability to release AMP in the presence of 4-MHA or other structurally related aromatic carboxylic acids, coenzyme A and ATP. Additional analysis of the activation reaction showed that it is exothermic, whereas the free enthalpy change delta G0 is positive due to a negative entropy change indicating a strong influence of restriction of random motion on the course of the reaction. Determinations of Km and kcat of various substrate carboxylic acids revealed the highest kcat/Km ratio for the natural substrate 4-MHA.

Studies of initial velocity as a function of uncomplexed Mg2+ (Mgf) in the absence and presence of dead-end inhibitors were used to define the kinetic mechanism. Data are consistent with the overall kinetic mechanism in the direction of MgADP phosphorylation being random with both the pathways allowed, i.e., the pathway in which MgADP binds to the enzyme prior to phosphorylated peptide and the pathway in which phosphorylated peptide binds to enzyme prior to MgADP. In addition, depending on the concentration of Mgf, one or the other pathway predominates. At low (0.5 mM) Mgf, the mechanism is steady-state ordered with the pathway in which phosphorylated peptide binds first being preferred; at high (10 mM) Mgf, the kinetic mechanism is equilibrium ordered, and the pathway in which MgADP binds first is preferred. This change in mechanism to equilibrium ordered at higher concentration of Mgf is due to an increase in affinity of the enzyme for MgADP and a decrease in affinity for the phosphorylated peptide.

The corresponding standard apparent entropy of the reaction (delta S' degree) was +4.70 J K-1 mol-1. The linear function (r2 = 0.99) between log10 K' and 1/K demonstrates that both delta H' degree and delta S' degree are independent of temperature for the creatine kinase reaction, and that delta Cp' degree, the standard apparent heat capacity of products minus reactants in their standard states, is negligible between 5 and 38 degrees C. We further show from our data that the sign and magnitude of the standard apparent Gibbs energy (delta G' degree) of the creatine kinase reaction was comprised mostly of the enthalpy of the reaction, with 11% coming from the entropy T delta S' degree term.

Optimal rate constants, derived by simulations of equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics data with the ISOBI program, indicate faster dissociation of amino acids than cofactors from the central complexes but nearly equal rates for association of cofactors and amino acids to free enzyme. Rate limitation of net turnover in both directions is determined by dissociation of cofactor from the E-cofactor complex. The allosteric modifier, L-threonine, produces distinctive perturbations of the saturation curves for isotope exchange, which were analyzed systematically with the ISOBI program. The best fit to the data was obtained by L-threonine inhibiting catalysis between the central complexes without altering substrate association-dissociation rates.

The aim of the present work was to determine whether glutamate chain length (one to six glutamate residues) influenced the affinity constant for tetrahydrofolate and the maximal velocities displayed by these two enzymes. The results show that the affinity constant decreased by at least one order of magnitude when the tetrahydrofolate substrate contained three or more glutamate residues. In contrast, maximal velocities were not altered in the presence of these substrates. These results are consistent with analyses of mitochondrial folates which revealed a pool of polyglutamates dominated by tetra and pentaglutamates.

Deviations, expressed as the ratio between calculated and measured ester mole fractions, usually were between 0.7 and 1.2. In the presence of solvents, the deviations of the monoester mole fractions were higher and rose up to 3. Without addition of a solvent, the ester mole fractions at equilibrium are dependent on the fatty acid chain length. With the short-chain hexanoic acid, the monoester mole fraction is the highest ester mole fraction, while for the long-chain oleic acid, the diester mole fraction is the highest one. The ester mole fractions become independent on the chain length of the fatty acid with a solvent added in a sufficient high concentration. Both reactions, with saturated and unsaturated C(18) fatty acids, lead to the same equilibrium position. The program TREP is found to make good predictions of the equilibrium amounts of ester and fatty acid. However, systematic deviations arise between measured and calculated amounts of water and glycerol in the organic phase. The calculated water and glycerol amounts are always lower than the measured ones. These deviations seem to be highest in nonpolar media and are probably due to deficiencies in the UNIFAC calculation method. Some preliminary experiments show the effect of the choice of solvent on the reaction rates. In polar solvents, the monoester production rate is enhances by a factor of 1.5 as compared to the reaction rate in a system without solvent.",Oct 1993,"A E Janssen, A Van der Padt, K V Riet"

Km values for nicotinate and PRPP each decreased by 200-fold when ATP was present to phosphorylate the enzyme. PPi stimulated the ATPase activity of the enzyme to Vmax values, suggesting that PPi formation during catalysis provides a trigger for cleavage of the putative E-P in the overall reaction and regenerates the low affinity form of the enzyme. A model is presented in which alternation of high and low affinity forms of NAPRTase provides a ""steady-state"" coupling between ATP hydrolysis and NAMN formation.",Dec 1993,"A Vinitsky, C Grubmeyer"

A complete initial velocity study in both reaction directions suggests that the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl CoA and L-serine to O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and coenzyme A (CoASH) by a ping pong bi bi kinetic mechanism. Initial velocity patterns in the absence of added inhibitors in both directions are best described by a series of parallel lines. Product inhibition by OAS is competitive with respect to acetyl CoA and noncompetitive with respect to L-serine, while product inhibition by L-serine is competitive against CoASH and noncompetitive against OAS. Glycine and S-methyl-L-cysteine (SMC) were used as dead-end analogs of L-serine and OAS, respectively. Glycine is competitive against L-serine, and uncompetitive against acetyl CoA, while SMC is competitive against OAS and uncompetitive against CoASH. All of the above inhibition patterns are consistent with those predicted for a single site ping pong bi bi kinetic mechanism. The equilibrium constant for the transacetylase reaction is 15 in the direction of serine acetylation. The constant was measured by monitoring the change in CoASH concentration obtained for reactions in which the ratio of acetyl CoA/CoASH was constant and the ratio of OAS/serine was varied.

We have established by equilibrium dialysis that a single H4folate-binding site exists per monomer of the dimeric domain and that the presence of nucleotides has two unexpected effects on H4folate substrate binding. Nucleotides containing a 5'-phosphate cause positive cooperativity in the binding of methyleneH4folate but not of 10-formylH4folate, and NADP increases the affinity for 10-formylH4folate by a factor of 25. The results indicate that dinucleotide preferentially binds before 10-formylH4folate in the reverse cyclohydrolase reaction, and this mechanism increases the efficiency of conversion of 10-formylH4folate to methyleneH4folate. We report new kinetic data that are also consistent with a steady-state random mechanism for this enzyme. To assess whether the enzyme functions at equilibrium in vivo, we determined the overall chemical equilibrium constant of Keq = 16 for ([10- formylH4folate][NADPH])/([methyleneH4folate][NADP]). Using this value and reported ratios of free dinucleotides and folate derivatives in vivo, we estimate that the cytosolic dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase reactions exist near the equilibrium position. However, the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase reactions in mitochondria are far from equilibrium and are poised toward 10-formylH4folate synthesis.

We have studied its equilibrium and transient kinetics in the direction of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-bis-P-glycerate) production: ATP + 3-P-glycerate<==>ADP + 1,3-bis-P-glycerate. We devised a sensitive method for following this production. PGK is mixed with 3-P-glycerate and [gamma-32P]ATP in a rapid flow quench apparatus. The reaction mixtures are aged for 4 ms or more and then quenched in acid in which any [1-32P]-1,3-P-glycerate decomposes to 3-P-glycerate and 32Pi, which is determined specifically. The Pi reflects accurately the 1,3-bis-P-glycerate in the original reaction mixture, and the kcat obtained is identical to that obtained by the conventional linked assay method with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This does not support the postulate of a rapid direct transfer of the 1,3-bis-P-glycerate between the kinase and the dehydrogenase [Srivastava, D. K., & Bernhard, S. A.

Mice were fed cCr or beta GPA and their muscles assayed for substrates and products of the CK reaction by 31P NMR spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. After three weeks of feeding, gamma was indistinguishable from Kcomb in cCr-treated muscles demonstrating both PCr/Cr and phospho-analog/analog must have equilibrated with a constant and uniform cellular ATP/ADP ratio. In beta GPA-treated muscles, gamma was smaller than Kcomb due to a higher content of muscle beta GPA. Feeding beta GPA for 9-12 weeks resulted in a closer agreement between Kcomb and gamma, suggesting ATP/ADP ratios are not uniform within the muscle perhaps due to transient metabolic stress in some cells. From this analysis it follows that calculation of free ADP from the CK equilibrium for a heterogeneous population of cells with respect to total Cr and ATP content is correct only if chemical potentials of these cells are uniform.",May 1995,"R W Wiseman, M J Kushmerick"

The distribution of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic marker enzymes indicates that the presence of mitochondrial arginine kinase is not due to cytoplasmic contamination. Arginine is not oxidized by the midgut mitochondria but, when metabolic substrates and ATP are present, respiration can be initiated by the addition of arginine. Under these conditions, there is no return to State 4 respiration, indicating regeneration of ADP by the arginine kinase reaction. Respiration can be blocked, however, by atractyloside, an inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocator. These results indicate that arginine kinase resides outside the matrix. Mitochondrial arginine kinase is specific to l-arginine since analogs of l-arginine are ineffective in stimulating respiration in the presence of ATP. Coupling between the adenine nucleotide translocator and arginine kinase was investigated using kinetic and thermodynamic approaches. There were no differences in the activities of arginine kinase in respiring and non-respiring mitochondria when they were measured at different ATP or arginine concentrations. This result indicates that arginine kinase does not have preferential access to the ATP exported out of the matix.

The three-dimensional structure of the recombinant human enzyme in complex with GMP has recently been solved [Eads, J., Scapin, G., Xu, Y., Grubmeyer, C., & Sacchettini, J. C. (1994) Cell 78, 325-334]. Here, ligand binding, pre-steady state kinetics, isotope trapping, and isotope exchange experiments are presented which detail the sequential kinetic mechanism of the enzyme. In the forward reaction, in which a base (hypoxanthine or guanine) reacts with PRPP to form nucleoside monophosphate and PPi, binding of PRPP precedes that of the base, and in the reverse direction, IMP binds first. Compared to k(cat), phosphoribosyl group transfer is rapid in both the forward (131 vs 6.0 s(-1)) and reverse (9 vs 0.17 s(-1)) directions. In the forward direction, product pyrophosphate dissociates rapidly (> 12 s(-1)) followed by release of IMP (6.0 s(-1)). In the reverse direction, Hx dissociates rapidly (9.5 s(-1)) and PRPP dissociates slowly (0.24 s(-1)). The more rapid rate of utilization of guanine than hypoxanthine in the forward reaction is the result of the faster release of product GMP rather than the result of differences in the rate of the chemical step. The kinetic mechanism, with rapid chemistry and slow product dissociation, accounts for the previously observed ability of the alternative product guanine to stimulate, rather than inhibit, the pyrophosphorolysis of IMP. The overall equilibrium for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transfer reaction lies far toward nucleotide product (Keq approximately 1.6 x 10(5)), at the high end for PRPP-linked nucleotide formation. The three-dimensional structure of the HGPRTase x IMP complex has been solved to 2.4 A resolution and is isomorphous with the GMP complex.

Choline kinase catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the CDP-choline pathway. The yeast enzyme was overexpressed 106-fold in Sf-9 insect cells and purified 71.2-fold to homogeneity from the cytosolic fraction by chromatography with concanavalin A, Affi-Gel Blue, and Mono Q. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified choline kinase matched perfectly with the deduced sequence of the CKI gene. The minimum subunit molecular mass (73 kDa) of purified choline kinase was in good agreement with the predicted size (66.3 kDa) of the CKI gene product. Native choline kinase existed in oligomeric structures of dimers, tetramers, and octomers. The amounts of the tetrameric and octomeric forms increased in the presence of the substrate ATP. Antibodies were raised against the purified enzyme and were used to identify choline kinase in insect cells and in S. cerevisiae. Maximum choline kinase activity was dependent on Mg2+ ions (10 mM) at pH 9.5 and at 30 degrees C. The equilibrium constant (0.2) for the reaction indicated that the reverse reaction was favored in vitro. The activation energy for the reaction was 6.26 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was labile above 30 degrees C. Choline kinase exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to choline and positive cooperative kinetics with respect to ATP (n = 1.4-2.3). Results of the kinetic experiments indicated that the enzyme catalyzes a sequential Bi Bi reaction. The Vmax for the reaction was 138.7 micromol/min/mg, and the Km values for choline and ATP were 0.27 mM and 90 microM, respectively. The turnover number per choline kinase subunit was 153 s-1. Ethanolamine was a poor substrate for the purified choline kinase, and it was also poor inhibitor of choline kinase activity. ADP inhibited choline kinase activity (IC50 = 0.32 mM) in a positive cooperative manner (n = 1.5), and the mechanism of inhibition with respect to ATP and choline was complex. The regulation of choline kinase activity by ATP and ADP may be physiologically relevant.",Mar 1998,"K H Kim, D R Voelker, M T Flocco, G M Carman"

The calorimetric measurements led to standard molar enthalpy changes for all four of these reactions. Direct measurements yielded an apparent equilibrium constant for the third reaction; equilibrium constants for the remaining three reactions were obtained by using thermochemical cycle calculations. The results of the calorimetric and equilibrium measurements were analyzed in terms of a chemical equilibrium model that accounted for the multiplicity of the ionic states of the reactants and products. Thermodynamic quantities for chemical reference reactions involving specific ionic forms have been obtained. These quantities permit the calculation of the position of equilibrium of the above four reactions as a function of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Values of the apparent equilibrium constants and standard transformed Gibbs free energy changes delta r G'(m) degree under approximately physiological conditions are given. Le Châtelier's principle provides an explanation as to why, in the metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis of L-tryptophan, the third reaction proceeds in the direction of formation of indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate even though the apparent equilibrium constant greatly favors the formation of 1-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate.",Jul 1998,"N Kishore, Y B Tewari, D L Akers, R N Goldberg, E W Miles"

The central pathway of benzoyl-CoA metabolism is initiated by an ATP-driven reduction of the aromatic ring producing cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The 1,5-dienoyl-CoA intermediate is thought to be transformed to 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA by a specific dienoyl-CoA hydratase catalyzing the formal addition of water to one of the double bonds. This dienoyl-CoA hydratase was detected in the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica after anaerobic growth with benzoate. Substrate and product were confirmed and a convenient spectrophotometric assay was developed. The equilibrium concentrations of substrate and product were almost equal. Enzyme activity was induced after anoxic growth with benzoate, in contrast to acetate. The enzyme of 28 kDa was purified from T. aromatica and was found to be highly specific for the cyclic 1,5-dienoyl-CoA. A second 29-kDa enoyl-CoA hydratase acted on crotonyl-CoA; this highly active enoyl-CoA hydratase also acted slowly on cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The regulation of expression of dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity, the kinetic constants, the substrate specificity, and the specific activity of the enzyme in cell extract provide evidence that dienoyl-CoA hydratase is the second enzyme of the central benzoyl-CoA pathway of anaerobic aromatic metabolism in T. aromatica. Extracts of Rhodopseudomonas palustris contained high activity of cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase, but no 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity. It appears that a variant of the benzoyl-CoA pathway is operating in R. palustris in which hydration of the 1,5-dienoyl-CoA does not take place. Rather, cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA is hydrated to 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA [corrected].",Aug 1998,"D Laempe, W Eisenreich, A Bacher, G Fuchs"

The classical ribonuclease mechanism involves a reversible transphosphorylation step, followed by quasi irreversible hydrolysis of the cyclic intermediate. We performed isotope-exchange and intermediate-trapping experiments showing that the second hydrolysis step is readily reversible in the presence of RNase A or RNase T1. As a consequence, the equilibrium between a phosphodiester and a 2',3'-cyclophosphate accounts for all catalysed reactions, even if the leaving/attacking group is a water molecule. Therefore, ribonucleases are transferases rather than hydrolases. The equilibrium constant for the catalysed interconversion is close to 1 M. From this result, we estimate the effective concentration of the 2'-hydroxyl nucleophile in the cyclization step to be 10(7) M.

This method is generally applicable to ultraviolet-visible diode array or rapid-scanning spectrophotometers and the measurement requires a single incubation of enzyme with two substrates. Rates at each of the wavelengths may be fit globally by using a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure which provides adequate statistical analysis. The specificity of trypsin for N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BRpNA) over N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-L-alanine-p-nitrophenylester (BocApNP) was 2.1 as measured by the multiwavelength partition method and 2.3 by comparing the individual kcat/K(m)'s for the two substrates. Multiwavelength analysis was applied to two enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for fungal melanin: scytalone dehydratase and trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from Magnaporthea grisea. The specificity of trihydroxynaphthalene reductase for 2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-4H-benzopyran-4-one compared to scytalone, a natural substrate for the enzyme, was 95. Scytalone dehydratase was eight-fold more specific for 2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-4H-benzopyran-4-one than it was for scytalone.

When enzymatic reduction is slower than the rate of epimerization of the two enantiomers, only (2R,3R)-erythro-fluoromalate is formed. Conversely, when a high enzyme level and excess of NADH lead to reduction that is fast relative to the epimerization rate, equal amounts of (2R,3R)-erythro- and (2R,3S)-threo-fluoromalate are formed. These data suggest that the V/K value for reduction of the R enantiomer to give the erythro isomer is approximately 100 times greater than for reduction of the S enantiomer to give the threo isomer. The equilibrium constant for the oxidation of fluoromalate is an order of magnitude less favorable than for oxidation of malate, while the equilibrium deuterium isotope effect from deuteration at C-2 of the substrate is 1.09 for fluoromalate versus 1.18 for malate.

The galacturonic acid-containing capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 is synthesized through the action of a specific UDPGLE. We have constructed a defined deletion mutant in the cap1J gene (one of the 15 cap1 genes responsible for the synthesis of the type 1 capsule) that exhibited an unencapsulated phenotype. This mutant was unable to synthesize UDPGLE, suggesting that Cap1J was the type 1-specific UDPGLE of S. pneumoniae. Escherichia coli cells harbouring the recombinant plasmid pRMM38 (cap1J) overproduced a 40 kDa protein, characterized as Cap1J on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and expressed high levels of enzymatically active Cap1J epimerase. Cap1J was partially purified, although purification to electrophoretic homogeneity inactivated the enzyme irreversibly.
